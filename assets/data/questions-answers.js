    question: "Is there a business size in mind for this program?",
    answer:
      "There is no restriction on the size of the business, and in fact the Administration is focused on engaging SMEs in this initiative as they often are less aware of these types of programs and opportunities. They don’t want it to just be the “usual suspects.” Large companies typically have the means to use internal resources on global mobility whereas smaller businesses don’t have that in-house expertise. This program is an example of how foreign policy can be brought to everyday Americans.",

    answer:
      "Once a company fills out the host business Statement of Interests someone from the State Department will contact them. If they meet the host requirements, the company will work with BridgeUSA to find the right sponsor, the right candidate, and then get that person a visa. Once a candidate is selected, the State Department issues a Statement of Eligibility that allows the exchange visitor to go to the US embassy in their country and get a visa. If someone is an academic and has previously traveled to the United States, they may not need an in-person interview.",

J visas are managed by the State Department and include education and cultural exchange in 15 categories. Sponsors must ensure there are resources available for the health and welfare of exchange participants. Different categories have different requirements on who pays for what—host organizations can pay, third parties, etc. The H-1B category is for occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific specialty at the entry level.

      "Consul-level implementation of this program will be case-specific, as different consulates are adjudicating visas differently in the pandemic context. The State Department is working closely with European consulates and it’s a priority to expedite visa processing for this visa whenever they can. o\tSome J-1 researchers will be eligible for an interview waiver if they have already used another visa category and therefore their biometrics are in the system and the U.S. embassy or consulate where they apply has implemented this waiver process.",

Researchers can conduct research, observe and/or consult for their host company. Beyond that there isn’t a definition in the regulations. Someone coming in as a research scholar does not need to have a PhD in a STEM field either. o\tThe various categories present a lot of versatility. In the training category, most will have a bachelor’s degree and at least one year  of work experience. This would be your typical “young professional” looking for the next step in their career. This is for up to 18 months. In the research category, the candidate would be someone who has specific expertise a company may want to bring in as a consultant.
