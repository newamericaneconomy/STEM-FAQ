    answer:
      "DOS invites prospective host companies and already-designated sponsors to consider the J-1 Early Career STEM Research Initiative. Many exchange programs, institutions of higher education, individuals, or host companies may already have the connections needed to explore the initiative. For example, a host company can discuss the initiative with a program sponsor, or an institution of higher education can discuss the initiative with local start-up companies. DOS also allows those interested to sign a “STEM Statement of Interest” and email a copy to JVisas@state.gov. These statements serve as a mechanism to recognize the Early Career STEM Research Initiative’s active partners and allow them to self-identify for participation. Neither host companies nor designated sponsors are required to sign up in this way—and they may find opportunities or connections on their own, through their own networks",

      'What is the definition of "research" for the J-1 early career STEM initiative?',
    answer:
      "DOS is continually adding to its FAQs and we hope to see more written guidance in the future. For now, working within a corporate research facility is clearly permitted as a safe harbor under <a href=https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/22cfr62#624f” target=”_blank”>22 CFR 62.4(f)</a>: Research scholar. A foreign national whose primary purpose is conducting research, observing, or consulting in connection with a research project at research institutions, corporate research facilities, museums, libraries, post-secondary accredited academic institutions, or similar types of institutions. A research scholar also may teach or lecture where authorized by the sponsor. Beyond that, we believe that “facility” does not necessarily require a separate physical structure devoted to research. Some smaller and mid-size companies often do not have an actual research facility, but may conduct research. We also believe that non-published research, such as proprietary applied research, is within the intent of this initiative. Less clear is applied research for clients without an overall research agenda. For example, a manufacturing company may want to hire an industrial engineer or an environmental scientist to research green energy solutions as it applies to their manufacturing processes. Or an architect working for an environmental consulting group may research design solutions to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) buildings. Pending further guidance, we recommend not using the J-1 program for applied research in the absence of an overall research agenda.",

      "Is there an age range or age cutoff for the Early Career STEM Research Initiative?",
    answer:
      "No, there are not controlling ages for the Early Career STEM Research Initiative. However, the different J-1 categories relevant to the Initiative have their own qualification requirements tied to the category. For example, a J-1 intern can seek entry to the U.S. for up to 12 months but must be a currently enrolled student at a foreign university or an individual who has graduated from a foreign university in the last 12 months. A trainee must already have a four-year degree from a foreign university and at least one year of related work experience outside the United States, or five years of experience in their field outside the United States, and may come for up to 18 months. Research scholars have no age restrictions and can come for up to five years.",

    question:
      "Regarding the O-1 guidance, can some of the additional suggestions for comparable evidence, such as giving talks, be used to satisfy one of the three required criteria?",
    answer:
      "The answer appears to be “no” based on the USCIS Policy Manual. Comparable evidence can only be used as a separate criterion when at least one of the other criteria do not readily apply to the field. For STEM research, all of the criteria in the regulations appear to apply. Therefore, we recommend presenting these other types of comparable evidence for the second stage of the O-1 analysis, also known as reviewing the totality of the evidence in the record. The USCIS Policy Manual supports this, and the new examples of comparable evidence help, since officers previously tended to discount talks at meetings, etc. When the evidentiary requirements for the criteria  are satisfied, an officer proceeds to evaluate the totality of all the evidence in the record to determine whether the beneficiary has extraordinary ability with sustained national or international acclaim, as described in the O statute and regulations. At this step, officers may consider any potentially relevant evidence, even if such evidence does not fit one of the regulatory criteria or was not presented as comparable evidence. The O-1 guidance provides a list of examples of the types of evidence that could be submitted and given weight as a positive factor during the totality of the evidence  determination. Facts such as giving talks and being named on government research grants should be provided for consideration in the totality of the circumstances stage.",
