    question:
      "How can organizations engage in the J-1 Early Career STEM Research Initiative?",
    answer:
      'In order for an employer to participate as a host, the employer would need to utilize the services of a <a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/research-scholar/#program-sponsors" target="_blank">program sponsor designated by the Department of State</a> (DOS) or become a designated sponsor. In order for an employer or institution to act as a designated program sponsor, the entity would have to <a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/sponsors/become-a-sponsor/how-to-apply/" target=”_blank”>file an application for designation</a> and receive DOS approval.\n \nThe initiative encourages designated sponsors to use the available categories to sponsor more individuals at host companies to engage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics activities, including STEM research. Much of the discussion of the initiative has been around the research scholar category, so that will be discussed in more detail here, but it is not the only option. The additional available categories include college and university students, professors, research scholars, short-term research scholars, interns, trainees, and specialists. \n\n\u000bMost universities are designated already to act as a program sponsor in the J-1 research scholar category, and some have already set up internal procedures to place J-1 Early Career STEM researchers at host companies. Other types of entities (such as nonprofit exchange programs, private colleges, consortia of state community colleges, and corporations) also have J-1 research scholar designation or are considering applying. <a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/early-career-stem-research-initiative/#get-started" target="_blank">This website</a> lists some sponsors designated for research scholar (and other categories) that have expressed interest in being matched with hosts for this Initiative. Host companies and participants are not limited to using organizations who have expressed interest to DOS, but rather can find their own program sponsors through local or research connections.',

    question: "Can chambers serve as sponsors and their members as hosts?",
    answer:
      "If a chamber or association is interested and has the experience to qualify as a sponsor, yes. But the best role for a chamber may be to communicate to its members the opportunity to host exchange visitors. Another possibility for chambers is to help form a consortium of interested company members that bands together and works with a single designated sponsor to bring research scholars to one particular place that serves as an innovation hub. This approach takes advantage of the fact that an established J-1 research scholar exchange program is most likely to have the expertise and personnel to support J-1 Early Career STEM researchers.

    question:
      "What qualifies as “research” for the purposes of this program and how is it distinguished from work that would be typically done on an H-1B visa?",
    answer:
      "This program is about cultural exchange, while at the same time research exchange visitors can participate in work that supports the mission of the host company and its commercial objectives. The work must be framed around doing research and gaining knowledge, even if it is product- or profit-oriented. The DOS FAQs clarify that: \n\n \n\n“A company, organization, or similar entity may host a J-1 Research Scholar, as long as it can ensure that program requirements are being met, the field of research aligns with the prospective exchange visitor’s area of study, and the host organization maintains the ability, personnel, and resources to achieve the goals and objectives of the Research Scholar’s program. Sponsors and host organizations have a shared responsibility to ensure whether a host organization will be a good match for an exchange visitor (e.g., determining that the necessary infrastructure is in place to host and support that exchange visitor during the program).” \n\n \n\nCompanies may host a J-1 Research Scholar without having a separate physical space devoted to research or even a separate research division. DOS states in its updated FAQs: “A STEM business does not have to have an independent research division to qualify as a host organization.”  But DOS also has clarified in its FAQs that host companies must be STEM-focused under this initiative. The DOS offers the example that a restaurant cannot be a host to an environmental scientist researching green energy solutions. \n\n \n\nWe also believe that non-published research, such as proprietary applied research, is within the intent of this initiative. Less clear is applied research for clients without an overall research agenda. For example, a manufacturing company may want to hire an industrial engineer or an environmental scientist to research green energy solutions as it applies to their manufacturing processes. Or an architect working for an environmental consulting group may research design solutions to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) buildings. Pending further guidance, we recommend not using the J-1 program for applied research for clients in the absence of an overall research agenda for the host company. \n\n \n\nTo summarize, host companies must have business activities that rely on a workforce in one or more science, engineering, technology, or mathematics disciplines, and where STEM research related to their business activities takes place. There is no requirement that a business have a separate research building or research division to qualify.",

    answer:
      "No, there are no controlling ages for the Early Career STEM Research Initiative. However, the different J-1 categories relevant to the Initiative have their own qualification requirements tied to the category. For example, a J-1 intern can seek entry to the United States for up to 12 months but must be a currently enrolled student at a foreign university or an individual who has graduated from a foreign university in the last 12 months. A trainee must already have a four-year degree from a foreign university and at least one year of related work experience outside the United States, or five years of experience in their field outside the United States and may come for up to 18 months. Research scholars have no age restrictions and can come for up to five years.",

    answer:
      "The answer appears to be “no” based on the USCIS Policy Manual. Comparable evidence can only be used as a separate criterion when at least one of the criteria do not readily apply to the field. For STEM research, all of the criteria specified in the regulation appear to apply. Therefore, we recommend presenting these other types of comparable evidence for the second stage of the O-1 analysis, also known as reviewing the totality of the evidence in the record. Some USCIS officers previously discounted evidence that did not fit into the eight criteria, such as talks at meetings, being named on a U.S. government grant, etc. The O-1 guidance provides a valuable appendix with a list of examples of evidence that could be submitted and given weight as a positive factor during the totality of the evidence determination. See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Policy Manual, Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 4, Section C.4 and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1A Evidentiary Requirements, https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4.",

    question:
      "How might federal ethics laws be relevant when requesting a letter from a government official in support of an NIW petition?",
    answer:
      'The public-facing guidance at some agencies states that a government official cannot sign a letter in support of a visa petition, where a template was provided by the individual, even if the letter is not on letterhead and does not mention the author\'s title. For one example, see <a href="https://ethics.od.nih.gov/sites/default/files/topics/visa-support-2007.pdf">here</a>.\n<br><br>\nThe relevant regulation is 5 C.F.R. § 2635.702(b), which prohibits a federal employee from creating the appearance of governmental sanction or endorsement of their or another’s personal activities. Given the guidance from some agencies, we suggest that providing a draft or template letter to the government official is not a best practice. We recognize that some agencies or nonprofits may draft general NIW template letters that list the author’s academic degrees, publications, and grant or project involvement. This type of template could also note that the field of research is a priority for the agency, perhaps citing any agency documents to that effect (such as noting that the research area has been a funding priority for X years and these projects were funded in the amount of $X). Each agency will decide whether the NIW support letter can be on agency letterhead or mention the author’s title. \n <br><br>\nWhen submitting a letter which is not on agency letterhead to USCIS, the author’s bio or LinkedIn profile showing where the author works could be attached to confirm the author’s background.  \n <br><br>\nThe government agency letter is not a recommendation letter; it is a statement of fact about the area of research described in the NIW petition. The goal is to show USCIS that the agency has an interest in the field. The letter can and will likely be quite short. Sometimes the letter may not mention the person for whom the NIW is being requested. Whether this would remove the support letter from the scope of 5 C.F.R. § 2635.702(b) is a decision for the in-house ethics counsel at the particular agency. We hope that over time, each STEM research funding agency will designate a point person to assist with NIW support letters and add public-facing policies.',

      "An employer who is prepared to sponsor an employee (or a prospective employee) in a STEM field to work in a job that requires an advanced degree should consider whether an NIW is feasible. Without an NIW, the employer would have to obtain a permanent labor certification from the Department of Labor before it could file an immigrant visa petition in the EB-2 category for advanced degree professionals or persons of exceptional ability. An employer who is considering sponsoring an employee (or prospective employee) in the immigrant visa category of Outstanding Professor or Researcher should consider whether the NIW category is a better fit. For example, a private employer may be concerned about the sufficiency of its documentation of “a department, division, or institute” with three full-time researchers and “documented accomplishments in an academic field,” as required for the Outstanding Professor or Researcher category. With the NIW, the employer can focus more on the employee’s (or prospective employee's) accomplishments than on its structure and past achievements through other employees.",
